Welcome to my portfolio! Hello! My name is Aishwar Pathak and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.

 My journey into web development began during the [Quaark (Tech Fest at BITS, Goa )](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_(technical_festival)), where I took on projects and was mentored by senior students from BITS Goa. Since then, I've been on an exciting path of continuous learning, working on various projects to enhance my skills in front-end and back-end technologies.

Beyond coding, I find joy in exploring the intricacies of geopolitics and the captivating stories of mythology. Combining my technical stack and diverse interests, I'm always seeking new opportunities to grow and make a meaningful impact. Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:aishwar.pathak20@st.niituniversity.in), as I'm eager to engage in a meaningful conversation with you.
